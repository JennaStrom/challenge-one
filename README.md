# UofM-Bootcamp-Challenge-1

## Description
My  motivation behind this project was to refactor the code to help improve the websites SEO ranking. I accomplished this by using semantic HTML code and cleaning up the redundant CSS code. I learned new html elements that will help the website show up in the proper search engines and how to combine CSS elements that have the same styling.
